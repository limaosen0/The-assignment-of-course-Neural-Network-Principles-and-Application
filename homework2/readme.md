This is the second homework of the course: Neural Network Principles and Application.

We use sklearn to finish  the project and sovle two problems proposed by the assignment.

You first need to save the data files in the folder: data, which is in the same path with the python files.

You can run main.py and adjust the variable: model_num = 1 or 2; and adjust the variable: separate_type = 'random' or 'prior', when model_num == 2.

And you also can choose whether to plot the data distribution frm PCA or tSNE.

The classification accuracy would be save in the folders of result.
