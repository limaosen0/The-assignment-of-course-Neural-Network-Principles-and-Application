This is the 4th homework of "Neural Network Principles and Application".

We design a LSTM model in order to classify a series of EGG data on Tnesorflow 1.5. You need to  prepare the data in the corresponding folder and run 'main.py' to obtain the running results. In order to finish a large series of experiments, we write 4 script codes to execute the program automatically.
